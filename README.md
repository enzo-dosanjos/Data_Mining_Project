# Data_Mining_Project

Find areas of interest in Flickr photos using clustering algorithms. Simply use the number of photos taken in a given area as an indicator of interest.

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Each picture is described using the following format:
⟨id photo, id photographe, latitude, longitude, tags, description, dates⟩.

It is possible to access a photo on https://www.flickr.com/photos/<user>/<id>, where
<user> is the user identifier and <id> is the photo identifier, e.g. https://www.flickr.com/
